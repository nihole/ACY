ACY = ACi from Yaml = deployment ACi from Yaml

The idea is to manage the Cisco ACI configuration via text files in YAML format. It allows you to
- use a simple interface for ACI configuration
- think about the configuration parameters only, and not about the command's syntax or GUI-navigation
- to use version control systems (for example, based on git) and follow the best practices of development for network infrastructure changes control.

The last point is a significant advantage over some other deployment methods (for example Deployment ACI From Excel).
