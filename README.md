# ACY

ACY = deployment Cisco <b>AC</b>I from <b>Y</b>aml = <b>AC</b>I from <b>Y</b>aml

Thus, ACY is rather the name of the approach, than the name of the software product.

The idea is to manage the Cisco ACI configuration via text files in YAML format. It allows you to
- use a simple interface for ACI configuration
- think about the configuration parameters only and not about the command's syntax or GUI-navigation
- use version control systems (for example, based on git) and follow the best practices of development for network infrastructure changes control

<h3>Installation</h3>

- clone this project to your local folder
- install Python3 with YAML and Jinja2 packages
- install Postman

<h3>Configuration procedure</h3>

The procedure is simple and mainly consists of three steps:

- fill in the YAML file
- generate the XML configuration file 
- upload it to ACI.  

You never change the Python rendering file <a href="https://github.com/nihole/ACY/blob/master/render.py">render.py</a> and generally you don't need to change Jinja2 templates.

Folder structure is important to understanding this project.

In the root directory there are 2 folders: `data` and `scripts`.

All ACI configuration data is always stored in the `data` folder and its nested subfolders. Any changes made as part of our configuration project should always be in the `data` folder and their subfolders. Users should never modify anything in the `scripts` folder.

The `data` folder can be excluded from git synchronization (using `.gitignore`), copied to another "protected" space, or be part of a separate repository. This is your data and you need to take care of it.

The `scripts` folder provides all the necessary tools and scripts. All Jinja2 templates are located here, along with all the scripts that help you create API calls. You can also find all the YAML templates that should be used for NIP creation. While there are some scripts in the `data` folder, they always call scripts located in the `scripts` folder and its nested subfolders.

The best way to understand is by following the example.

<h3>Example</h3>

<b><em>All the steps described here are already completed. So, you don't need to do anythingâ€”just click the links to view the configuration files. The setup for all objects in example_new has been tested on Cisco dCloud LAB.</em></b>

Let's consider, for example, that we want to create a new VLAN pool.

1. Go to the correspondent folder. In this case it is <a href="https://github.com/nihole/ACY/tree/master/data/example_new/configuration/access_policies/global_policy/vlan_pools">data/example_new/configuration/access_policies/global_policy/vlan_pools </a>

There are 3 files already there: <a href="https://github.com/nihole/ACY/blob/master/data/example_new/configuration/access_policies/global_policy/vlan_pools/mkconf.py">mkconf.py</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nihole/ACY/blob/master/data/example_new/configuration/access_policies/global_policy/vlan_pools/vlan_pools.xml">vlan_pools.yml</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/nihole/ACY/blob/master/data/example_new/configuration/access_policies/global_policy/vlan_pools/vlan_pools.xml">vlan_pools.xml</a>.

- vlan_pools.yml - this is YAML file that we are using for keeping configuration of VLAN pools. 
- vlan_pools.xml - the body for API call that we will use for ACI configuration. This file is created with using of data from vlan_pools.yml file.
- mkconf.py - python file that creates vlan_pools.xml from vlan_pools.yml file. Actually, this file calls another python script from the folder `scripts` folder: <a href="https://github.com/nihole/ACY/blob/master/scripts/render.py">render.py</a> and this script uses Jinja2 Template that is locates also in corresponding subfolder of `scripts` folder. In this case this Jinja2 template script is <a href="https://github.com/nihole/ACY/blob/master/scripts/configuration/access_policies/global_policy/vlan_pools/template.j2">template.j2</a> 

1. Create a new folder (if it has not been done before). Actually you may use any folder, but it looks reasonable to create a new folder in the current one. Let's create a folder <a href="https://github.com/nihole/ACY/tree/master/access_policies/global_policy/aaep/example1">example1</a> 
/render
```
mkdir example1
```

1. Copy file vlan_pools_tmpl.yml (if it has not been done before) to this folder and rename it:

```
cp vlan_pools_tmpl.yml ./example1/vlan_pools.yml
cd ./example1/
```

4. Fill in <a href="https://github.com/nihole/ACY/blob/master/access_policies/global_policy/aaep/example1/aaep.yml">vlan_pools.yml</a> with configuration parameters

5. Generate <a href="https://github.com/nihole/ACY/blob/master/access_policies/global_policy/aaep/example1/aaep.xml">aaep.xml</a> file for ACI configuration 

```
python3 ../../../../render.py ../template.j2 vlan_pools.yml > vlan_pools.xml
```

6. Upload this file to ACI (see the next chapter).

<h3>Upload configuration to ACI</h3>

The described approach can result in many XML files. We can use many API requests to load these files into ACI, but this does not look very scalable.

This project provides a tool to collect individual API requests into one Postman collection.

1. Go to the folder <a href="https://github.com/nihole/ACY/tree/master/postman">postman</a>
```
cd postman
```
There are 3 files here: 
- <a href="https://github.com/nihole/ACY/blob/master/postman/check_collection.py">create_collection.py</a> - is a Python script used for the Postman collection file generation (with using of Jinja template and YAML configuration files as input)
- <a href="https://github.com/nihole/ACY/blob/master/postman/template.j2">template.j2</b> - Jinja2 template used as input for the create_collection.py
- <a href="https://github.com/nihole/ACY/blob/master/postman/collection_tmpl.yml">collection_tmpl.yml</a> - we use this file as a template for new collection YAML files.

2. Create a folder <a href="https://github.com/nihole/ACY/tree/master/postman">example1</a> (if it has not been done before). Actually you may use any folder, but it looks reasonable to creare a new folder in the curent one.

```
mkdir example1
```
3. Copy file collection_tmpl.yml to the new folder with renaming. For example a new name maybe all.yml

```
cp collection_tmpl.yml example1/all.yml
```

4. Fill in a new file <a href="https://github.com/nihole/ACY/blob/master/postman/example1/all.yml">all.yml</a>

5. Generate collection file <a href="https://github.com/nihole/ACY/blob/master/postman/example1/all.json">all.json</a>

```
cd example1
../create_collection.py ../template.j2 all.yml > all.json
```
6. Start Postmat and import this collection

7. Run this collection in Postman
